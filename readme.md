Big-O Complexity

In this lab, I've explored time and space complexities across various code examples. I've analyzed complexities ranging from O(n) for linear iterations to O(1) for constant-time operations to O(n) for quadratic time complexity. I've also examined the impact of auxiliary data structures on space requirements. Functions with nested loops exhibited higher time complexities, reinforcing the concept of constant space complexity. Understanding these complexities is essential for designing algorithms that optimize resource utilization.
